## What is this project?

This is my first project built with javascript and its a simple snake game.

## How to play?

In the starting menu there are 4 buttons but only the "play" and the "settings" buttons work. In the settings page you can change the game difficulty and snake colora and you can start playing the game by pressing the play button. Use arrow keys or wasd keys to controll the snake. The game has all the basic snake functionality like eating apples, but you can also pause the game when you want to.

## Some issues

The app isn't perfect and has some unfinished parts that include: "share" and "leaderboards" buttons not doing anything, some of the text overflows out of its box.
